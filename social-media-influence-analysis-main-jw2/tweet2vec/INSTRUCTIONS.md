# Setup and Requirements

Depending on your operating system, follow the instructions below to run the program.

## MacOS/Linux

### Requirements

Download and install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/) if you don't already have it. Confirm that `python -V` outputs `Python 2.7.*`.

### Setup

Open a terminal window and ensure that you are in the top directory of the outermost `/tweet2vec` folder. Then:

1. Run `pip2 install virtualenv`
2. Run `which python2` and denote the output to be `<python_path>`
3. Run `virtualenv -p <python_path> venv` using `<python_path>` from above
4. Run `source venv/bin/activate`
5. Install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To deactivate the virtual environment, run `deactivate`.

## Windows

### Requirements

Note: we did have difficulties running the preloaded tweet2vec models on Windows due to different dependency versions with the original owners of the repo. If you are using this to preprocess data or train your own embedding model, Windows should be fine. However, to use the preloaded models we found that running on an unix based machine (Linux/Mac) seemed the best approach.

Download and install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/) if you don't already have it. Check the path to the directory where python 2.7 is installed in your system (usually of the form `<path>\Python27\`).

For embedding data, donwnload and install [MinGW C++](https://github.com/niXman/mingw-builds-binaries/releases) from one of the 64-bit release versions outlined in that github. Here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRxPUblx2SY&ab_channel=AnielMaharajh) that may help.

### Setup

Open PowerShell window and ensure that you are in the top directory of the outermost `/tweet2vec` folder. Then:

1. Run `<path>\Python27\Scripts\pip.exe install virtualenv`
2. Run `<path>\Python27\Scripts\virtualenv.exe venv`
3. Run `venv/Scripts/activate`
4. Confirm that `python -V` outputs `Python 2.7.*`
5. Confirm that `pip -V` outputs `pip 20.3.4 from <path_to_pip> (python 2.7)`
6. Install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`

To deactivate the virtual environment, run `deactivate`.

# Preprocessing Data

The Twitter API returns a json file with unnecessary extra fields that might affect performance for larger files. In addition, a tweet may have unwanted hashtags, HTML tags, usernames and URLs. Therefore, we levarega some of `tweet2vec`'s data preprocessor with a few changes to perform some data cleaning.

`python /tweet2vec/misc/preprocessor.py <path_to_data>/tweets.json clean_tweet`

And this will generate two text files `clean_tweet_ids.txt` and `clean_tweet_text.txt` that are the clean and ordered text from the tweets and their corresponding ids.

`clean_tweet_text.txt` can be loaded directly into the models to obtain latent embeddings.

For ease of user, we create a script `./preprocess_and_encode.sh` that takes in a raw json file of tweets from the Twitter API, preprocess the data according to our standards and embedds the data according to our models.

# Embedding Data

Ensure your tweet data json file (the tweet data from Twitter's API) is the `misc` folder, and ensure you are in `misc` by running `cd misc`. Then, run the following command to generate your embeddings:

`./preprocess_and_encode.sh`
